    <p>This website was built for Beginning Webpage Development by Gavin Kritchard.</p>
    <h2>Welcome to my personal project</h2>
    <p>I'm excited for the few people who decided to look at this to see everything my skills have lead up to in the 2023 Autumn Term at IHCC! Several things are linked in the header for you to exploreto your liking! Those things are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>About me to read all about me!</li>
        <li>My future plans and aspirations in Dreams</li>
        <li>Family to see the family who helped make me into me</li>
        <li>Random to see some of my hobbies and interests that don't fit anywhere else</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With all that said I hope you enjoy!</p>
