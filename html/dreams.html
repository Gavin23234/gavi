    <h1>My Goals/Dreams</h1>
    <p>This page is going to have a short list of my goals, both short and long term, and my dreams for the future of myself and how I plan to get there.</p>
    <h2>Short terms goals</h2>
    <p>My current goals for this category involve me graduating high school with a decent gpa, becoming a freshmen (officially) at Indian Hills, and nailing a few scholarships. To graduate I just need to not fail my current English course, I'm techically a student at Indian Hills already so that part is done techically, and I need to start looking into scholarships that are being offered for the colleges I want to go to.</p>
    <h2>Long term Goals</h2>
    <p>Some of my long term goals involve me getting accepted to either Fullsail University (in Florida), or Southern New Hampshire University and get my Bachelor's in Computer Science or Game Design. This along with nailing a good job that's developing games would be amazing for me. These 2 colleges aren't the hardest to get into by all means but I will try my hardest anyway, and that job will only come with time and commitment so I got that as long as I stay true.</p>
    <h2>Dreams</h2>
    <p>My current dream is to be a game developer for an Indie company trying our hardest to make a few games that would wow the public, and something that I would be proud of. Other than that I don't have any other dreams I currently have in sight. Maybe find love? I'm sure I'll figure that out eventually.</p>
    <h1>Final Bit</h1>
    <p>This section doesn't have much in terms of content but is probably my most important page simply because I attempted to lay out my future for the public eye. Thank you for looking in this page though.</p>
